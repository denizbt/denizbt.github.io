I was selected to conduct research at Carnegie Mellon University during Summer 2023 as part of prestigious Research Experience for Undergraduates in Software Engineering.  During the summer and after as a part-time Research Assistant, I closely collaborated with Dr. Claire Le Goues and members of squaresLab in the Software and Societal Systems Department at CMU.

I researched decompilation (converting machine code back into source code) of C programs using NLP techniques to predict variable names and types. I also co-wrote "Quantifying and Mitigating the Impact of Obfuscations on Machine-Learning-Based Decompilation Improvement" which was recently accepted to a security conference (DIMVA: Detection of Intrusions and Malware & Vulnerability Assessment).
